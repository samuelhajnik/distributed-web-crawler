# Observability

This project treats **metrics + structured logs** as first-class operator tools.

## Metrics endpoints

| Service       | URL (Docker network)                | Host dev                        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Control plane | `http://control-plane:3000/metrics` | `http://localhost:3000/metrics` |
| Worker        | `http://worker:9091/metrics`        | map `9091` if published         |

Prometheus (Compose): **http://localhost:9090** — verify **Targets** are healthy.

## What to watch (and why)

### Counters / gauges (existing)

- **`crawl_runs_*`**, **`crawl_urls_*` counts** — throughput and terminal outcomes.
- **`processed_urls_total`** (worker) — increments once **after a run-level BullMQ signal led to a successful Postgres claim** and processing finishes for that URL row (`VISITED`, terminal outcomes, or return to `QUEUED` for retry). Does **not** increment when no eligible URL was claimed for that signal.
- **`crawl_urls_queued_gauge`**, **`crawl_urls_in_progress_gauge`**, **`crawl_urls_failed_gauge`** (control-plane) — aggregates across **`RUNNING`** crawl runs (see exporter definitions for exact filters).
- **`crawl_stale_claims_recovered_total`** — lease recovery firing (crashed / stuck workers).
- **`crawl_queue_reconciliation_*`** — how often reconciliation attempted **`topUpRunSignals`** (bounded additions toward **`DISPATCH_SIGNALS_PER_RUN`**) because Postgres showed claimable `QUEUED` work—enqueue-gap safety valve, **not** “publish every queued URL.”
- **`crawl_completion_checks_total`** + logs — progress toward stable completion.

### Latency / performance (P2)

**Worker**

- **`crawl_fetch_duration_seconds`** — time for the gated `undici` request until the response object is returned (headers available). Rises when the origin is slow, TCP/TLS is slow, or you are saturating your own concurrency gate.
- **`crawl_processing_duration_seconds`** — end-to-end handling **after a successful claim** (includes HTML body read, parse, DB inserts for discoveries, **bounded signal top-ups**, terminal state writes). Separates “network read” from “local work”.
- **`crawl_queue_latency_seconds`** — `now - job.timestamp` at job start. Elevated when workers are saturated, Redis is slow, or concurrency is too low vs incoming work.

**Control plane**

- **`crawl_reconciliation_cycle_duration_seconds`** — wall time for one full maintenance sweep across all RUNNING runs. Spikes when Postgres is slow, many runs are active, or reconciliation batch sizes are large.

## Detecting common failure modes

| Symptom                     | Likely signal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stuck frontier              | Gauges show `QUEUED>0` forever; reconciliation counters increase; queue latency high; check **`retry_after_at`** (URLs may be intentionally not claimable yet)                                                                                                                    |
| Retry storm                 | `crawl_urls_retried_total` climbs; `crawl_fetch_duration`/`processing` erratic                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Slow origin                 | `crawl_fetch_duration_seconds` p95/p99 up; `processing` follows if HTML is large                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Reconciliation churn        | `crawl_queue_reconciliation_enqueued_total` high vs visit progress—signals topping up but **not converting to claims** (workers saturated, run not `RUNNING`, URLs awaiting **`retry_after_at`**, Redis/control-plane issues); long `crawl_reconciliation_cycle_duration_seconds` |
| Near completion oscillation | completion logs + empty-frontier streak (see README)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Logs

- Control plane: `[component=control-plane] crawl_run=…`
- Worker: `[worker worker_id=… crawl_run=… url_id=…]`

Worker logs keep **`url_id`** on the hot path because processing is **per claimed URL row**, even though BullMQ carries **run-level** signals—use logs to stitch **`crawl_run_id`** + **`url_id`** back to metrics.

## A “healthy” run (conceptually)

- `crawl_queue_latency_seconds` stable and low relative to your expectations.
- `crawl_fetch_duration_seconds` consistent with the remote site.
- `crawl_reconciliation_cycle_duration_seconds` small vs reconciliation interval.
- Gauges trend toward zero frontier, then run completes (`crawl_runs_completed_total` increments once).
